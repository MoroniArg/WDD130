    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The target audience for this website is Rexburg residents, particularly BYUI students aged 18–25. They are busy with school and work but enjoy Pokémon GO as a social and outdoor activity. They want to find players with similar levels and schedules for raids and events. Currently, it's difficult for them to connect with compatible players. Most will access the site via mobile devices while gaming.</p>
