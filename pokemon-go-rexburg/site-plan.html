      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Pokemon Go is a mobile game that allows its players to interact and move around in the real world, visit new places, meet new people, and create communities. As students and residents in Rexburg - Idaho, we strive to create a community that will both benefit us as players and also meet the standards of Scopely (the owner), and that will allow us to have a member of our community become a Pokemon Go approved ambassador. The purpose of the same page is to inform the local players of the community we are creating and who they can look forward to playing and working with. </p>  <!-- change this -->
